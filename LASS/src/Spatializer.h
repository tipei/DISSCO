/**
 *	A Spatializer is a definition of an object that
 *	will spatalize (move around in space; this is a generalization
 *	of panning) a single sound over multiple channels.
 *	The default action of this spatializer will evenly distribute the
 *	sound over the requested number of channels.
 *	Each Spatializer must be dynamic enough to allow spatialization
 *	to a number of different channels specified at run-time.
